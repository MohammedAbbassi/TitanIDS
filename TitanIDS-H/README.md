# TitanIDS-H BETA 🚨

**TitanIDS-H** is a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) designed to monitor Windows endpoints for suspicious activity in real-time. It detects persistence artifacts, suspicious processes, and other host-level anomalies to enhance endpoint security.

---

## Features

- **Persistence Monitoring** – Detects new or unauthorized startup entries, scheduled tasks, and registry modifications.
- **Process Monitoring** – Identifies suspicious process execution or risky command lines.
- **JSON Logging** – All alerts are logged in a structured JSON format for easy integration with SIEM tools.
- **Duplicate Alert Suppression** – Reduces alert noise by suppressing repeated alerts within a configurable window.
- **Lightweight & Modular** – Can run continuously on a Windows host with minimal resource usage.
